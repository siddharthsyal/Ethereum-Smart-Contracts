A simple banking application with the following functions :

-> Deposit :
The caller can send ether to the smart contract and the respective account balance is updated. 

-> Withdraw :
The caller can withdraw ether from his account balance. If all the conditions are satisfied, then the smart contract initiates the fund transfer. 

-> Getbalance :
The caller can check the balance of his account maintained by the smart contract.

-> CreateAccount :
The caller can create the account with the banking application. If the account already exists, the contract throws an error. 

-> GetContractBalance :
The caller can check the balance of the smart contract. Only the admin can view the result of the function call.

Note : The smart contract is under developement. Will update the source code as I progress.
